# Embedded-Application-Development
An electronic mass production tool with GUI based on the IMX6ULL development board.
Project description: Using IMX6ULL_PRO development board and capacitive touch screen as the hardware platform, Ubuntu, Source Insight, MobaXterm and FileZilla as the software platform, based on the basic knowledge of application development and driver development, developed a mass production tool with GUI for electronic products, which is used to test the functional status of each module of the system. The program framework contains six systems: display/input/text/UI/page/business.
1.Mastered Framebuffer application programming, text display programming, network communication programming, multi-threaded programming, etc.;
2.Familiar with object-oriented driver development, including driver development for bus devices, device tree writing and interrupt handling.
